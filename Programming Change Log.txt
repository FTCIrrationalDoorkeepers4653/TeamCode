- 3/18/2020 - Developer(s): Sushen Kolakaleti
Added comments and explanations in code, for (GitHub Repository -> FTC_IDK_VISION_LIB Repo in GitHub)
- 3/19/2020 - Developer(s): Sushen Kolakaleti
Made HardwareMaps and Autonomous Detector Initializations Conscience by Putting in Autonomous Robot. (See GitHub Repository -> FTC_IDK_VISION_LIB Repo in GitHub)
- 3/20/2020 - Developer(s): Sushen Kolakaleti
Made FTC_IDK_VISION_LIB with new packages, and added learning changes to the UILA ML Library.
- 3/22/2020 - Developer(s): Sushen Kolakaleti
Removed excess Skystone season files and added move to position roadrunner autonomous mapping as well as gyro corrections and resets.
- 3/23/2020 - Developer(s): Sushen Kolakaleti
Reorganized Skystone season assets for possible MTI competition and started auto programming with coordinates.
- 3/24/2020 - Developer(s): Sushen Kolakaleti
Finished positioning auto with a new vision pipeline for possible MTI and made current autonomous programs more consistent with parking, foundation, and setup.
- 3/26/2020 - Developer(s): Sushen Kolakaleti
Added driver enhancement of aligning to stones, touched up the autonomous programs (both positional and regular), and organized code more for possible MTI tournament. 
- 3/27/2020 - Developer(s): Sushen Kolakaleti
Added driver single-button enhancement and removed auto-align due to runtime issue, and organized code further to make it more modular from year to year. Made everything ready for possible testing for possible MTI tournament.
- 3/28/2020 - Developer(s): Sushen Kolakaleti
Fixed driver button enhancements and fixed parking shortcomings during the autonomous period. Made code more ready for testing before possible MTI tournament.
- 3/31/2020 - Developer(s): Sushen Kolakaleti
Fixed some FTC_IDK_VISION_LIB systems of the binary detector and improve the efficiency of the vision system overall.
- 4/9/2020 - Developers(s): Sushen Kolakaleti, Matthew Bucy, Grace Matthews
Fixed Bugs in Autonomous, added FTC crash course code, and made code ready for possible MTI, CRI, and NCRI competitions in the summer.
- 4/11/2020 - Developer(s): Sushen Kolakaleti
Fixed some autonomous logical issues and fixed a recalibration bug in the IDKAutonomousRobot.java class for the autonomous.
- 6/16/2020 - Developer(s): Sushen Kolakaleti
Finished coding the FTC_IDK_VISION LIB and its dependencies and tests, and integrated UILA_API ML Library with it and is now deployed to GitHub and Jitpack.
- 6/24/2020 - Developer(s): Sushen Kolakaleti
Added the Torch control in the VuforiaImageInit class and fixed some detection bugs as well. Additionally, cleaned up code and comments to be more coherent with the team's programming style.
- 9/14/2020 - Developer(s): Sushen Kolakaleti
Added pixel count and pixel density support for the VuforiaDetector and the FTC_IDK_VISION_LIB support in the TeamCode.
- 9/28/2020 - Developer(s): Sushen Kolakaleti
Added RGB 565 coding support to the FTC_IDK_VISION_LIB, setup TeleOp and Autonomous for the Ultimate Goal Season. Changed the image in AutonomousMapping application for Ultimate Goal
- 9/29/2020 - Developer(s): Sushen Kolakaleti
Updated and finished preliminary autonomous for parking and main autonomous. Fixed major distance bug in the AutonomousMapping application.
- 10/4/2020 - Developer(s): Sushen Kolakaleti
Fixed a bug regarding the Positional Movement and the vision library, also was able to run the parking autonomous successfully. Also found another bug in the vision library with Vuforia that in the process of fixing.
