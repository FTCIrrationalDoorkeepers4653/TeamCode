# Team 4653 Irrational DoorKeepers Team Code

This is the Code library for FTC Team #4653 Irrational DoorKeepers from Northern Guilford High School in Greensboro, NC.
This Repository Contains All of the Coding We Did, Including All Autonomous, TeleOp, and Calibration Testing. And....MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU!!!

## Change Log:

- Setup 2021-2022 season code.

- 12/20/2021: Modified the slide movement for the linear slides so it goes up to the appropriate height.
Coded the servos basketServo, intakeServo to move the basket and push the game elements into the basket.
Also coded levelsServo so when the linear slides bring the game element up to the drop zone, the angle of the ramp determines which level the element drops into.
Began coding the Autonomous.
