#4653 Irrational DoorKeepers Programming Change Log

- 9/14/2020 - Added pixel count and pixel density support for the VuforiaDetector and the FTC_IDK_VISION_LIB support in the TeamCode.

- 9/28/2020 - Added RGB 565 coding support to the FTC_IDK_VISION_LIB, setup TeleOp and Autonomous for the Ultimate Goal Season. 
Changed the image in AutonomousMapping application for Ultimate Goal.

- 9/29/2020 - Updated and finished preliminary autonomous for parking and main autonomous. Fixed major distance bug in the AutonomousMapping application.

- 10/4/2020 - Fixed a bug regarding the Positional Movement and the vision library, also was able to run the parking autonomous successfully. 
Also found another bug in the vision library with Vuforia that in the process of fixing.

- 10/6/2020 - Added Machine Learning to the FTC_IDK_VISION_LIB, and fixed the vision library for Ultimate Goal and overall. 
Also, restructured the code and made the code more readable. 
Additionally, restructured project and added TensorFlow and OpenCV vision detections as backups.

- 10/7/2020 - Added Coordinate Mapping and YOLO ML Detection to Vision Lib. Also, added EasyOpenCV Support and DogeForia Support along with a start on the 
Vision Positional Mapping Software. 

- 10/10/2020 - Changed the Positional Movement Software (PMS) to be single movements at a time for more customization. Also, fine tuned the values and vision inputs to make
the main autonomous work on the blue and red allicances. We plan to work on the Vision Positioning Mapping Software (VPMS) further.
